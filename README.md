# Kaggle-30-days-of-ML

## Active code repository with tutorials as well as my notebooks for each day

**Day 1-7** : Python
<br>
**Day 8-11** : Introduction to Machine Learning


**Intermediate ML**
<br>
Day 11, 12 : Housing price prediction, missing value treatment(mean, median, mode, adding true/false column for missing values) using simple imputer. Categorical variables treatment.

Day 13 : Pipelines, Cross-Validation : Optimise code using pipelines for pre-processing and modelling and use cross-validation to get average model errors and for hyper-parameter tuning: choosing best n_estimators for random forest model
